# 1.2
## 1.2.1
-   IBL pre-proc: add the channel removal code to the computing of the whitening matrix 

## 1.2.0 alpha02
-   fix bug for the last template (Kush)

## 1.2.0 alpha01 
-   ibllib > 2.5.0 pre-processing (destriping)
    -   channel rejection and interpolation before destriping
    -   uses the pykilosort parameters for the high-pass filter
    -   multi-processing version of the destriping
-   QC:
    -   destriping outputs the RMS of each batch after pre-processing
    -   outputs
