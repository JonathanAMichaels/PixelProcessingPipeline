## Examples

If you would like to try on a sample recording then you'll first need to download the test dataset. The easiest way to do that is like so

```
# from the examples/ directory

pip install -r example_requirements.txt
python download.py
```

Then you can sort the downloaded data using test\_sort.py

```
python sort.py
```
